# Dual Representation Pattern

## Core Concept

### 1. Transaction Log View
```
[T1] -> [T2] -> [T3] -> [T4] -> [T5]
```
- Sequential operations
- Reversible changes
- Complete history
- Computational overhead for state reconstruction
- Minimal storage overhead
- Perfect for audit trails

### 2. Snapshot View
```
Time₁: {complete state}
Time₂: {complete state}
Time₃: {complete state}
```
- Point-in-time state
- Direct access to any state
- Higher storage overhead
- Fast access to specific states
- Can derive transactions by diffing

## Performance Characteristics

### Transaction Log
```
Advantages:
- Minimal storage (only deltas)
- Perfect audit capability
- Natural causality tracking
- Easy to append new changes

Disadvantages:
- O(n) reconstruction cost
- Expensive for random access
- Computation increases with history
```

### Snapshot Store
```
Advantages:
- O(1) state access
- Fast queries at any point
- Easy to compare states
- Efficient for reading

Disadvantages:
- O(n) storage cost
- Space increases with history
- More complex to update
```

## Hybrid Strategy

### 1. Sliding Window
```
Recent: Full Snapshots
[State₁] [State₂] [State₃]
Historic: Transaction Log
[T₁->T₅₀] [T₅₁->T₁₀₀]
```

### 2. Access Patterns
```
Hot Data (Recent):
- Full snapshots
- Quick access
- Frequent queries

Cold Data (Historic):
- Transaction log
- Space efficient
- Audit purposes
```

### 3. Transition Rules
```
When: 
- Data age > threshold
- Access frequency drops
- Storage pressure high

Action:
- Convert snapshots to transaction log
- Maintain key checkpoints
- Preserve query capability
```

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. Storage Management
```python
class TimelineStorage:
    def store_change(self, change):
        # Always log the transaction
        transaction_log.append(change)
        
        # Update recent snapshots
        if is_recent(change.timestamp):
            update_snapshots(change)
        
        # Check for compression opportunities
        maybe_compress_history()
```

### 2. Access Patterns
```python
class TimelineAccess:
    def get_state_at(self, timestamp):
        if is_recent(timestamp):
            return get_from_snapshot(timestamp)
        else:
            return reconstruct_from_log(timestamp)
```

### 3. Compression Policy
```python
class CompressionPolicy:
    def should_compress(self, timeline_segment):
        return (
            segment.age > THRESHOLD_AGE and
            segment.access_frequency < THRESHOLD_FREQ and
            segment.storage_pressure > THRESHOLD_STORAGE
        )
    
    def compress(self, timeline_segment):
        # Convert snapshots to transaction log
        transactions = derive_transactions(timeline_segment)
        # Store with checkpoints for faster access
        store_with_checkpoints(transactions)
```

## Usage Patterns

### 1. Recent Activity
```
- Keep full snapshots
- Maintain transaction log
- Fast access to current state
- Quick queries and diffs
```

### 2. Historical Analysis
```
- Convert to transaction log
- Maintain checkpoints
- Space efficient
- Preserves audit capability
```

### 3. Hybrid Access
```
- Recent: O(1) access via snapshots
- Historic: O(log n) access via checkpointed log
- Balanced storage/compute trade-off
```

## Optimization Strategies

### 1. Checkpoint Selection
```
- Frequency based on access patterns
- Key business state transitions
- Important merge points
- Regulatory requirements
```

### 2. Compression Triggers
```
- Storage pressure
- Access patterns
- Data age
- Business rules
```

### 3. Performance Tuning
```
- Adjust snapshot window
- Optimize checkpoint frequency
- Balance storage/compute
- Monitor access patterns
```
