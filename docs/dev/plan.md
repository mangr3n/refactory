# The Re-factory: Intelligent Change Management System

## Project Overview
The Re-factory is an intelligent change management system that treats code and state changes as a manufacturing process, with raw materials (states) flowing through production lines (timelines), being transformed (transactions) according to specifications (business rules), and efficiently stored (compression) for just-in-time delivery (access patterns).

## Core Components

### 1. Production Floor (Chronosphere Storage Engine)
The heart of our factory, where changes are processed:
- Raw Material Storage (Persistent Data Structures)
- Assembly Lines (Transaction Logs)
- Quality Control (CRDT Validation)
- Warehousing (Compression Strategies)

#### Phase 1: Factory Setup

- [ ] Line integration (merging)
- [ ] Quality assurance (conflict resolution)
- [ ] Production monitoring (visualization)

### 2. Quality Control (Query Engine)

- [ ] Performance optimization

### 3. Process Engineering (Business Rules)
