# The Re-factory: Intelligent Change Management System

## Project Overview
The Re-factory is an intelligent change management system that treats code and state changes as a manufacturing process, with raw materials (states) flowing through production lines (timelines), being transformed (transactions) according to specifications (business rules), and efficiently stored (compression) for just-in-time delivery (access patterns).

## Core Components

### 1. Production Floor (Chronosphere Storage Engine)
The heart of our factory, where changes are processed:
- Raw Material Storage (Persistent Data Structures)
- Assembly Lines (Transaction Logs)
- Quality Control (CRDT Validation)
- Warehousing (Compression Strategies)

#### Phase 1: Factory Setup
- [ ] Raw material handling (persistent structures)
- [ ] Production line design (transaction logs)
- [ ] Quality control systems (CRDT operations)
- [ ] Basic warehousing (compression)

#### Phase 2: Process Optimization
- [ ] Smart assembly (rule-based compression)
- [ ] Process monitoring (pattern detection)
- [ ] Resource allocation (strategy selection)
- [ ] Just-in-time delivery (caching)

#### Phase 3: Production Management
- [ ] Multiple production lines (branching)
- [ ] Line integration (merging)
- [ ] Quality assurance (conflict resolution)
- [ ] Production monitoring (visualization)

### 2. Quality Control (Query Engine)
- [ ] Product inspection (temporal queries)
- [ ] Process analysis (causal relationships)
- [ ] Pattern recognition
- [ ] Performance optimization

### 3. Process Engineering (Business Rules)
- [ ] Manufacturing specs (rule representation)
- [ ] Quality standards (validation)
- [ ] Process improvement (rule learning)
- [ ] Resource optimization (rule-based compression)
